#  One Child Policy's Effects on China's Population 

## Question

* How did the One Child Policy in
1979 affect China’s child population
growth?
* Context: To explain the connection
between the One Child Policy and
child population

## Model

* Parameter: different growth rates
* Linear model (to model growth rates over
certain time periods)
* We read about the history of China’s
population from 1960 - 2015
* We focused on the growth rate because that
is the most relevant to the One Child Policy

## Results

## Conclusions

* Growth rate was reduced by 3.6% due to the One
Child Policy
* The real child population data does show slight
growth in 1985 and 2009
  * 1985 - Two child Policy introduced in rural areas
  * 2009 - Two Child Policy expanded across China
